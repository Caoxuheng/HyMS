# [Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution via Multi-stage Scheme without Employing Spatial Degradation](https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.473020)
This is an optimization-based algorithm that fuses hyperspectral and RGB images without employing spatial degradation.  For an HSI with the size of 16x16x31, the proposed HSMS can achieve 32x spatial improvement with high accuracy in 2 seconds. The quantitative results outperform the existing optimized-based algorithm and most deep-learning-based algorithms.    
An online version based on AI-Studio is released. You can apply our algorithm on the CAVE dataset without configuring the system environment >>>>[*Online Version*](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/projectdetail/4418051)<<<<
# Note
There are two versions of HyMS. The GPU-based one and CPU-based one. GPU-based methods can complete super-resolution tasks in a short amount of time, but since GPU-based Newton's methods do not take into account that the denominator cannot be zero, this version may fail on some images. The CPU-based one is the stable version.

# Abstract
Recently, it has become popular to obtain a high spatial resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI) by fusing a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high spatial resolution RGB image (HR-RGB). Existing HSI super-resolution methods are designed based on a known spatial degeneration. In practice, it is difficult to obtain correct spatial degradation, which restricts the performance of existing methods. Therefore, we propose a multi-stage scheme without employing the spatial degradation model. The multi-stage scheme consists of three stages: initialization, modification, and refinement. According to the angle similarity between the HR-RGB pixel and LR-HSI spectra, we first initialize a spectrum for each HR-RGB pixel. Then, we propose a polynomial function to modify the initialized spectrum so that the RGB color values of the modified spectrum are the same as the HR-RGB. Finally, the modified HR-HSI is refined by a proposed optimization model, in which a novel, to the best of our knowledge, spectral-spatial total variation (SSTV) regularizer is investigated to keep the spectral and spatial structure of the reconstructed HR-HSI. The experimental results on two public datasets and our real-world images demonstrate our method outperforms eight state-of-the-art existing methods in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.
