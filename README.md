# Hyperspectral Image Super resolution via Multi-stage Scheme without Employing Spatial Degradation (HSMS)
This is an optimization-based algorithm that fuse hyperspectral image and RGB image without employing spatial degradation.  For an HSI with size of 16x16x31, the proposed HSMS can achieve 32x spatial improvement with high accuracy in 10 seconds. The quantitative results outperform exisiting optimized-based algorithm and most deep-learning based algorithms.    
The code will be published after the article published.
